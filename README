Also try out the dull, low contrast version: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1407

This color scheme has a dark greyish blue background and a blue number line and folding column, and has shades of tan (from orange to wheat) for highlighting syntax. This scheme is made for a GUI; terminal colors are still set to the defaults set by the Desert color scheme. I made this scheme using Desert as a starting point and looked to make it have similar qualities with OceanDeep and Zenburn as well. The final result uses mostly a sandy foreground with a fairly high contrast with the greyish blue background.

Feedback is appreciated! I will respond to any questions.
